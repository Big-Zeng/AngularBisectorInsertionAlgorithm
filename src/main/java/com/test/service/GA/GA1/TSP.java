/**
	TRAVELLING SALESMAN GENETIC ALGORITHM

	The main class loads the indices, names, latitudes and longitudes from a .csv file. 
	It creates an array of Town objects using these values.
	it creates a (1-indexed) adjacency matrix of the distance between the towns. 
	For each run of the genetic algorithm, it creates a Population object using these arrays.
	The Population is also initialised with a given size and mutation rate.
	The Population starts with random (but valid) Paths of Towns.
	As long as the the best distance found by the Population has changed recently enough,
		1. Keep track of the best Path of each generation and print new ones
		2. Add Paths to the mating pool accoring to their relative fitness
		3. Pick 2 Paths at random from the mating pool and combine with the crossover function
		4. (Possibly) mutate this path before re-populating with the generated child Path
		5. Get the fitness (distance) of each Path in the Popluation using a fitness function. 
	The best Path from each Population is stored from each run.
	The best Path from these is returned as the answer.
